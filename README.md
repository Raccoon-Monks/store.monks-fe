## Tracking Solutions Ecommerce
This is a mock ecommerce website for educational and testing purposes. It was built on `create-next-app` boilerplate.

## Installing the Repository

First of all, install the dependencies with
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the project locally

Run one of the following commands, depending on wich package manager you use;
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Branching

The `master` branch is PR-restricted since it is the one which will be built for production;

The `develop` branch is supposed to be sync'd with `master` and it should be the target to every PR made.

To start coding a task, create your branch from `develop` using the following naming conventions:

TODO-- BRANCH NAMING CONVENTIONS

```
Remark: Since there will be many people working in this project, always rebase your branch with `origin develop` so you don't miss any merged functionality. Also, rebase your branch before pushing commits and opening PR to `develop`.
